# 🚀 30 Projects in 30 Days Challenge

A personal coding sprint to build 30 projects in 30 consecutive days. This challenge is designed to improve coding skills, explore new technologies, and build a diverse portfolio.

## 📋 Challenge Rules

1. **Build one project per day** for 30 consecutive days
2. **Document each project** with a brief description and learnings
3. **Code must be written on the same day** (no pre-built templates)
4. **Projects can be small** - focus on completion over perfection
5. **Share progress** to stay accountable
6. **If you miss a day**, reset and start again (or continue with adjusted timeline)

## 🎯 Goals

- Build consistent coding habits
- Experiment with different technologies and frameworks
- Create a diverse portfolio of projects
- Learn through rapid prototyping
- Overcome perfectionism and analysis paralysis


*The goal is progress*
